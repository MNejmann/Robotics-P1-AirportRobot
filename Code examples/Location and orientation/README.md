This code is targetet to make the zumo to perform a action with a given x- y-coordinates.

This is in theory done by the zumos encoder and gyroscope, where it can calculate how far it have moved and in what angle, and there for can calculate its x- and y-coordiantes by using trigometry.

To be able to use this code, its mandatory to use the two files "TurnSensor.cpp" and "TurnSensor.h", in the same arduino program, just open a new tab in the code and paste the two files in there.
Its also requires to use the zumo libary and the L3G.h libary by pololu.
